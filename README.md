This project is for learning porpuse, it's a set of libs to use opengl and GLFW to create a 2D game, trying to make utilitys for other people to create a game more quickly,
i want to extend it more, probably make something near like "game maker", but that is still far.

In this moment the build system just create a project for visual studio 2017 to 2022 with premake, of course you can change the scripts or create another to tell to premake to create for other IDE or create a makefile for linux.

In the scripts folder there are .bat files to create the solution files for Visual studio 2017 to 2022 with the premake windows binarie.

In the Vendor/Binaries/Premake there are different premake binaries for the OS you use to execute a script to tell to the binarie of premake to create a project.

I wiil change this for people to make it quickly, but for now i leave it this way.

I have to clean the code and delete some comments of code i don't use anymore and var declarations that are not usefull to, sorry for the mess, i will clean it, and rename
certain things to, because they don't make of how they are named and explain somethings is use for experiment, use logs for benchmark with ImGui to see the performance,implement better math functions for the physics and write better in english (is not my first language).

I will document better this project but for now i leave it this way.
