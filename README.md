This project if for learning porpuse, it's a set of libs to use opengl and GLFW to create a 2D game, trying to make utilitys for other people to create a game more quickly,
i want to extend it more, probably make something near like "game maker", but that is still far

In this moment the build system just create a project for visual studio 2017 to 2022 with premake, of course you can change the scripts or create another to tell to premake to create for other IDE or create a makefile for linux.

In the Vendor/Binaries/Premake there are different premake binaries for the OS you use to execute a script to tell to the binarie of premake to create a project

I wiil change this for people to make it quickly, but for now i leave it this way.

I will document better this project but for now i leave it this way.
